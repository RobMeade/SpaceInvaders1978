# Space Invaders (1978)

Challenge: Recreate a retro video game.  The game of choice, Space Invaders (1978).

Having previously created a clone of Space Invaders using Unity, I thought I'd try with Unreal Engine aswell.

## Features

## Assets
Assets were used from the Unreal Engine Example Content project (Input Example) for both the player and the invaders.  Re-purposing the static meshes, I created the mystery ship and the bunkers.

## Development

The project was created using Unreal Engine (4.22).  Code was written using Blueprint.  The project makes use of many of the core aspects of Unreal Engine, including; Interfaces, Enums, Particle Systems, Sound Cues, and User Widgets.
